# VBA-challenge
Week 2 - Stock Analysis Challenge

This VBA Challenge takes a large dataset of annual stock ticker values at open, high, low, and close, and total volume for 3 years and summarizes with the Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume per stock ticker.  It also summarizes the stocks with the highest percentage increase, lowest percentage decrease, and the highest stock volume.

This is done using vba coding in the developer tools and running a macro.

Thank you for reviewing my work.
